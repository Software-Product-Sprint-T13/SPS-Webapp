                        <p>
                            Here, our goal is to connect those with non-traditional educations/experience, that hold skills or even an interest in a certain field. Not everyone goes for university degrees, 
                            or has the means to pay for them! And that is more than alright, but sadly, much of the popular job market, markets want for higher education as a requirement. This proves an 
                            obstacle for those that may hold vocational certificates/diplomas, rather than a Bachelor's, Master's, and so forth. Especially virtually, where some online applications do 
                            not have a selection for trade schooling. </p>
                        <p>
                            Or, you could be a freelancer, having years of experience in contracted jobs, but no former schooling in your craft. Some skills heavily popularized as of today may get a pass 
                            (i.e. computer-related skillsets) but for things such as artistry (painting, writing etc), botany, bladesmithing, proffesional eater, etc. getting exposure is quite difficult the
                            more obscure your interests. Especially those that aren't really clear in learning yourself, and are only better through those with in-world experience, such as being a business owner or entrepreneur for example.
                            But it does exist! It's just a bit of an issue to find...but that's why this is here! 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We want to connect you to high-rising successes in your field of interest! Specifically, to offer a means to a beginning in looking for a way up in that career. 
                            Everyone needs their start, so here is that starting line. CEOs, entrepreneurs, business owners, their secretaries, assistants and even other apprentices in the business could be reached once you know where to look.
                            So, take a look at our roster, and see what catches your eye!
